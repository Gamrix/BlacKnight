Welcome to BlacKnight's documentation!
======================================

BlacKnight is a fault-management tool for constructing *cloud software appliances*. It monitors the state of the appliance and, in the event of a change, adjusts the configuration to make the best use of the available resources. By automating this task, which is traditionally performed by a sysadmin or DevOps team, BlacKnight makes it possible to create self-contained appliances that will run for long periods of time without human intervention.
