# TODO
* Come up with a better name than farmcloud...
* Args for actions (node, primary, &c.)
* ZK permissions for roles (i.e. an application shouldn't be able to create  non-existant roles, &c.)
* Deployment state is queried before ephemeral nodes die - sleep(1) for now
* Manage differences between IaaS roles and PaaS/Saas roles (exclusivity, node location)
